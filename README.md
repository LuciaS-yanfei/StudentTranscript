# My Personal Project: Transcript Management Application

## Project Description

**What will the application do?**

Transcript Management Application will be similar to services such as “Your Grades Summary” 
in UBC student services center. This application will keep track of information about all the courses 
each student has registered for since they first enrolled in school. Of course, not only can students 
see their overall performance over the years, but students can also calculate percentage scale (100%) 
based on different semester's respectively. In addition, information about each course is clearly displayed 
on the transcript, such as course name, semester, credits, course average and student's grade. What's different 
from UBC's grade summary is that students can also check all the awards they have won over the years.

**Who will use it?**

Almost all students need a transcript management application to have an overview of their academic performance, 
their grades and their awards. The idea of this app is to help students keep track of their course grades and 
information so that not only do they adapt better and sooner to their academic life, but later on, when students 
apply to graduate schools or jobs, they can easily have a clearer transcript.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

I found that although there were similar programs already in place, none of them met my needs completely. 
For example, If I could be able to also view my awards on the transcript, it will show a more comprehensive 
picture of my academic performance of my university life because I don't want grades to be the only measure.
In addition, I would like to provide a more clean and nice looking user interface that is easier to navigate.
