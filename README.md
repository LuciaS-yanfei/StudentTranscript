# My Personal Project: Transcript Management Application

## Project Description

**What will the application do?**

Transcript Management Application will be similar to services such as “Your Grades Summary” 
in UBC student services center. This application will keep track of information about all the courses 
each student has registered for since they first enrolled in school. Of course, not only can students 
see their overall performance over the years, but students can also calculate percentage scale (100%) and
grade point average (GPA) equivalent on a 4.33 scale based on different semester's respectively. 
In addition, information about each course is clearly displayed on the transcript, 
such as course number, section, credits, professor, and section grade point average.

**Who will use it?**

Almost all students need a transcript management application to have an overview of their academic performance. 
The idea of this app is to help students keep track of their course grades and information so that not only do 
they adapt better and sooner to their academic life, but later on, when students apply to graduate schools or jobs, 
they can easily have a clearer transcript.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

I found that although there were similar programs already in place, none of them met my needs completely. 
For example, I could only see a percentage GPA on the UBC transcript page, but if I wanted to display my GPA on 
UBC's own 4.33 scale, I would have to look it up myself. In addition, I would like to provide a more clean and nice 
looking user interface that is easier to navigate.

course number, worth credits, professor's name, etc.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of courses on my transcript list.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a course from my transcript list.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a course as completed and specify my final grade and course average on my 
transcript list.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a course on my transcript list and view the course information.
